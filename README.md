# Java-code-to-create-NFA-that-can-recognize-digits-of-a-language

This repository contains a Java file that demonstrates how to create a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) that can recognize the digits of a language. The NFA is implemented using the Thompson's construction algorithm.

## Getting Started
To run the code, you will need to have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website.

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/username/Java-code-to-create-NFA-that-can-recognize-digits-of-a-language.git
```

## Running the code
You can run the code by executing the following command in your terminal:
```bash
  javac NFA.java
  java NFA
```
The program will then output the transition table of the NFA, which you can use to test the automaton with different input strings.

# Understanding the code
The code contains the following main classes:
- NFA: This class contains the main method which is used to create and test the NFA.
- NFAConstructor: This class contains the implementation of the Thompson's construction algorithm, which is used to construct the NFA.
The program is well commented, you can go through the code to understand the implementation of the NFA and Thompson's construction algorithm.
