# Java-code-to-create-NFA-that-can-recognize-digits-of-a-language

This repository contains a Java file that demonstrates how to create a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) that can recognize the digits of a language. The NFA is implemented using the Thompson's construction algorithm.

# Understanding the code
The code contains the following main classes:
- NFA: This class contains the main method which is used to create and test the NFA.
- NFAConstructor: This class contains the implementation of the Thompson's construction algorithm, which is used to construct the NFA.
The program is well commented, you can go through the code to understand the implementation of the NFA and Thompson's construction algorithm.
